            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Royate Hill Community Orchard sits on a strip of allotments in Easton, Bristol. In the 1980s the local council proposed selling off the allotment site for development. Allotment holder and permaculture educator Mike Feingold responded by planting fruit trees across several plots. This guerrilla planting demonstrated that the land was in use and helped prevent its sale. Over the years the orchard has grown into a thriving community space where locals learn about fruit growing and sustainable land stewardship.</p>
            <p>Mike invited neighbours and students to take on plots, encouraging hands‑on permaculture practice. Seasonal events such as Apple Day and wassailing bring people together to celebrate the harvest, press apple juice and enjoy mulled cider. The orchard’s under‑the‑viaduct location has become a haven for wildlife, skills‑sharing and friendship.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>The orchard is currently managed by volunteers. Regular Saturday work days involve pruning, grafting, mulching, mowing, building compost bins, maintaining paths and tending vegetable beds. We also run workshops on fruit‑tree care, cider and vinegar making and host community celebrations.</p>
            <p>All income comes from small‑scale sales of cider, cider vinegar and fruit trees. We have never charged for workshops and we rely on goodwill and volunteer labour to cover plot rents, occasional skip hire and compost‑loo servicing.</p>

            <h2>Get Involved</h2>
            <p>We’re looking for more volunteers to help sustain and grow the orchard. Whether you can spare a few hours on a work day, assist with organising events or contribute administrative skills, there’s a role for you. No experience is necessary — you can learn alongside our experienced gardeners.</p>

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>Our founder Mike plans to step back over the next year or so. We’re forming a committee and drafting a constitution to formalise the group, protect volunteers from liability and ensure the orchard’s longevity. A small working group will also research legal structures (such as community associations or community interest companies) and open a bank account.</p>
            <p>We’re committed to keeping Royate Hill Community Orchard open to all, continuing the tradition of sharing knowledge, harvests and good company. With your help we can keep this unique green space flourishing for future generations.</p>
